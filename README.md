Obstacle dodging game created with an Arduino Mega, LCD TFT display, and a joystick.

v0.1 - Initial Commit
Initial hardware design created and game logic implemented (input, simulate, render frame-by-frame).
Player is a green square that can move around on the display in 8 directions.
Walls prevent the player from going off-screen. 
Pause functionality included by pressing in the button on the joystick. The player has 3 seconds to get ready after unpausing. 
No obstacles or collision detection added as of yet.
